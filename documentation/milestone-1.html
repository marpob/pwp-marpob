<h1>Martin Poboril - Personal Website (milestone 1)</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This project will be a professional portfolio website with a focus on front-end and back-end web development,
and tennis skills.</p>

<h2>Audience:</h2>
<p>This site is designed with a professional audience in mind, and is targeted to individuals within web development
with focus on a tennis software products worldwide. Target audience to include: startup founders, hiring managers,
recruiters, and tennis brands owners.</p>

<h2>Goal:</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this site is for users to initiate contact with me in regard to employment
and collaboration opportunities through the contact form, and the connected social media profiles. The secondary
goal of this site is to showcase my work, and to contribute to a professional online presence.</p>

<h2>Persona</h2>
<p><strong>Name: </strong>Roger Federer</p>

<p><strong>Age: </strong>38</p>

<p><strong>User Story: </strong>As a user, I need to determine whether this person is a candidate for the mid-level
Full Stack web Developer position with tennis experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Profession: </strong>Founder of tennis-numbers.com, a startup that is looking to hire a full-time,
in-house or online Full-stack web developer with experiences in tennis. We have just received our first round
of founding from the state tennis federation. Our products are a web based applications focusing on young tennis players
development.</p>

<p><strong>Technology: </strong>Mac power user. Uses a Mac Pro laptop, and an iPhone 17 Pro with an unlimited 4G data
connection.</p>

<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong>Very busy, overworked, and has a full social schedule. Roger will not spend
more than 1 minute max looking at anyone's portfolio website, and only about 30 seconds on a resume. Roger is a huge
social media user, and seeks potential candidates through tech and tennis community networking events, LinkedIn, and Instagram.</p>

<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong>Roger needs to hire someone with 1-3 years of Full-stack web development and
more than five years of experiences as a tennis coach or former professional tennis player who is willing to start at a
competitive mid-level salary. Roger is also looking for someone who is a good personality and cultural fit for the startup.
Tennis-numbers.com is still small but fast-growing business. It can only offer limited benefits at this time, but will
include equity option as a part of the compensation package. It is very hard to find somebody because there are not enough
candidates with the right skills. Roger is receiving many resume applications, but most of the time the candidates do
not have enough skills in both fields (full-stack development and tennis). The perfect candidate will also work as a bridge
between the technical world and tennis. Roger must hire within a month.</p>

<p><strong>Goals: </strong>Roger is concerned if there are candidates with all the skills he is looking for. There are
many candidates who have great skills in full-stack web development but not enough skills in tennis or vice versa. Since
Roger is very busy he needs to know immediately from the personal website or resume that this is the right person to
schedule with him or her the phone call.</p>
